AmplificationTester
===================

A simple script to test if a machine is prone to being used in reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.

Currently it supports tests for DNS, NTP and CHARGEN attacks.

Todo

- SNMP
- QotD
- Backend for saving larger searches etc. And a nice web-gui for it
- Suggestions?
